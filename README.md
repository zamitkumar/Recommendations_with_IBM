Recommendation System Using IBM Watson Studio Data

**Introduction**

In this notebook, we will build a recommendation system using real-world data from the IBM Watson Studio platform. 
The goal is to apply machine learning techniques to recommend products, services, or content based on user preferences, past interactions, or other relevant information.

**Step 1: Import Required Libraries**

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
from sklearn.neighbors import NearestNeighbors


**Step 2: Load the Data**
**Step 3: Data Preprocessing**
