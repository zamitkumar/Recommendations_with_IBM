# Recommendations with IBM

This project involves analyzing user interactions with articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform to build a recommendation system. The system suggests personalized articles to users based on their interaction history, employing various recommendation methodologies.


## 📋 Project Overview

The goal of this project was to explore user-article interaction data from the IBM Watson Studio platform and build multiple types of recommendation systems to enhance user engagement.


## 🔑 Key Components

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Investigated and visualized the dataset to understand the user-item interaction patterns.
   - Answered key questions about the dataset to inform the development of recommendation methods.

2. **Rank-Based Recommendations:**
   - Created a recommendation system based on article popularity.
   - Suggested articles with the highest interactions as recommendations for all users.

3. **User-User Collaborative Filtering:**
   - Built a recommendation system by finding users with similar interaction patterns.
   - Suggested articles that similar users interacted with.

4. **Content-Based Recommendations (Optional):**
   - Explored content-based methods using Natural Language Processing (NLP).
   - Suggested articles based on their textual content.

5. **Matrix Factorization:**
   - Developed a machine learning-based recommendation system using matrix decomposition.
   - Predicted user-article interactions by training a model on interaction data.


## 🛠️ Methodology

### **Data Analysis**
- Examined the dataset, including user-article interactions, to gain insights.
- Prepared the data for various recommendation algorithms.

### **Recommendation Systems**
- **Rank-Based:** Identified and recommended the most popular articles.
- **Collaborative Filtering:** Compared user interaction histories to recommend articles.
- **Matrix Factorization:** Applied Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for predictive recommendations.

## 💡 Learning Outcomes
- Deepened understanding of recommendation systems and their applications.
- Gained hands-on experience in building rank-based, collaborative, and machine learning-based recommendation systems.
- Enhanced skills in Python, pandas, scikit-learn, and NLP techniques.
